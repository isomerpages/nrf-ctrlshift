## A MODEL ESTATE

For better estate planning, HDB employed modelling tools to simulate environmental conditions such as wind flow, sun and shade. They were used to plan and design new precincts and building forms within Singapore's first "eco-precinct" Punggol town. These resulted in smart HDB homes in districts such as the waterfront Punggol Northshore. HDB is progressively leveraging smart modelling tools to complement town planning efforts in providing well-designed homes in green, sustainable and self-sufficient towns.

### COMPLEX SYSTEMS MODELLING (CSM)
CSM simulates the built environment of a city and its impact on resource utilisation, environment, people and costs. With this decision-making tool, HDB planners can analyse and determine the best combination of strategies, using both design and technological solutions, to create a more ideal living environment for residents. For example, the CSM would make assessments on competing needs easier to evaluate, such as deciding on the use of a roof space – whether it is to be installed with solar panels to achieve lower carbon emissions or preserve the space to enhance greenery. CSM has been tested in the Yuhua estate in Jurong, under the HDB Greenprint project, which completed in Nov 2015.

### URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING (UEM)

One of the smart technologies used in Punggol Northshore is environmental modelling, which studies the wind flow, temperature, solar irradiance, and shadow casting at Punggol Northshore District, in order to aid decision-making during the planning and design process. Such data can help planners decide where to place outdoor amenities, such as playgrounds and fitness corners, as well as optimal locations for future installation of solar panels.
